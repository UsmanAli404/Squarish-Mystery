# What's the Area?

**Visualisation of a Math Problem using p5.js**

This is an interactive simulation of a puzzle where a square is subdivided into 5 rectangles, each with the **same area**. One of them is labeled with a known width of `3`. The goal: **find the area of the whole square**.

Turns out, the answer is **12 × 12 = 144**, but the geometry behind it reveals something deeper. As you interact with the sketch—clicking on tiles and adjusting dimensions using the **arrow keys**—you'll notice how altering one rectangle reshapes the entire configuration while preserving equal areas.

## 🔧 How to Run

- Clone or download the repository.
- Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
- Click on the rectangles to select them.
- Use arrow keys to **stretch** or **squish** the selected rectangle and observe the transformation.

## 💡 Concept

This visualization is based on a classic geometric puzzle. It demonstrates how **area conservation** works even when dimensions shift. It's a playful yet insightful look into spatial reasoning.
