# What's the Area?

## visualisation of a math problem using p5js
Given a square composed of 5 rectangles. Each one having the same area and one of them having a width of 3, find the total area of the square?
while it turns out that the area is 12*12 = 144, you can see how changing the width of one of the rectangles change the overall shape's dimensions.

run index.html in your browser from the folder that contains all the rest of the files to find out how.
